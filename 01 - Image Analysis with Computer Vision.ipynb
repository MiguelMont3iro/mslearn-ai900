This is made possible by the fact that digital images are essentially just arrays of numeric pixel values, and we can use those pixel values as *features* to train machine learning models that can classify images, detect discrete objects in an image, and even generate text-based summaries of photographs.\n","\n","## Use the Computer Vision Cognitive Service\n","\n","Microsoft Azure includes a number of *cognitive services* that encapsulate common AI functions, including some that can help you build computer vision solutions.\n","\n","The *Computer Vision* cognitive service provides an obvious starting point for our exploration of computer vision in Azure. It uses pre-trained machine learning models to analyze images and extract information about them.\n","\n","For example, suppose Northwind Traders has decided to implement a \"smart store\", in which AI services monitor the store to identify customers requiring assistance, and direct employees to help them. By using the Computer Vision service, images taken by cameras throughout the store can be analyzed to provide meaningful descriptions of what they depict.\n","\n","### Create a Cognitive Services Resource\n","\n","Let's start by creating a **Cognitive Services** resource in your Azure subscription:\n","\n","1. In another browser tab, open the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com, signing in with your Microsoft account.\n","2.

Wait for deployment to complete. Then go to your cognitive services resource, and on the **Overview** page, click the link to manage the keys for the service.
